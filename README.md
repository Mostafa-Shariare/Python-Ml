# ML & Python Learning Repository

This repository is a collection of my learning journey in Python and Machine Learning. It contains explanations, tutorials, practice codes, and small projects that I have completed.

The goal of this repository is:

* To document everything I learn in a structured way.
* To create a reference for myself and others learning similar topics.
* To gradually build a solid foundation in Python and Machine Learning.
